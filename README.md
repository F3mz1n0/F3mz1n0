# Secure Blog Web Application

A full-stack blog web application developed as part of a Computer Science degree, focusing on secure system design, clean architecture, and database-backed functionality.

## Overview
The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts through a secure, role-based system. It follows the Model–View–Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and applies secure programming practices throughout the codebase.

## Key Features
- User authentication with session management
- Role-based access control
- SQL-backed CRUD functionality for blog posts
- Input validation and access control to mitigate common web vulnerabilities
- Separation of concerns using MVC architecture

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Java  
- Database: SQL  
- Architecture: MVC  
- Version Control: Git & GitHub  

## Security Considerations
- Server-side input validation
- Session-based authentication
- Access control checks on protected actions
- Secure handling of user data

## Testing & Documentation
- Unit tests written for core functionality
- Technical documentation and class diagrams produced as part of the coursework
